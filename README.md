# Game

The goal of this project is to develop a simple game as a way to improve my software skills as well as learning lua with the framework Love2D to develop games.

The game will be developed by cycles, starting with the simplest version with the basic features and adding more as the time and ideas go on.

## Description of the game

The game is based around the RPG-style combat system using a 2D fighting game screen. The camera gives a view of the frontal plane of the scene where the character controlled by the player and the enemies are on opposites sides of the screen. Using a turn based system the characters will move and attack until one of the two parties is defeated.

## Advanced description of the mechanisms of the game

You can find more information about characters, enemies, and mechanics on the wiki of this project, as well as algorithms used to calculate things like damage number of turns.
